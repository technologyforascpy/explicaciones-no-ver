    Batman is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil and strikes
    terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity he is Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist
    and notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest
    fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent.

    Princess Diana grew up Themyscira, otherwise known as Paradise Island. This island full of only women is completely
    detached from man’s world. The group formed their own society and cultivated their world. Diana grew up believing
    she was born from clay, but it wasn’t until later that it was revealed that Diana did indeed have a father, that
    being Zeus. She trained with the God of War as she was growing up, only to leave him after she realised the
    importance of mercy. Later on she meets her first mortal man, Steve Trevor after he crashed on the island. This
    eventually leads her to man’s world where she becomes Wonder Woman.

    Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times
    more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel
    rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman
    kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the
    autonomic reflexes.
