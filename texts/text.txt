Batman - Spiderman - Superman - Wonder Woman
BATMAN
Batman is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil and strikes terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity he is Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent. 
SPIDERMAN
Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes.
SUPERMAN
Rocketed to Earth as an infant from the doomed planet Krypton, Kal-El was adopted by the loving Kent family and raised in America's heartland as Clark Kent. Using his immense solar-fueled powers, he became Superman to defend mankind against all manner of threats while championing truth, justice and the American way!
WONDER WOMAN
Princess Diana grew up Themyscira, otherwise known as Paradise Island. This island full of only women is completely detached from man�s world. The group formed their own society and cultivated their world. Diana grew up believing she was born from clay, but it wasn�t until later that it was revealed that Diana did indeed have a father, that being Zeus. She trained with the God of War as she was growing up, only to leave him after she realised the importance of mercy. Later on she meets her first mortal man, Steve Trevor after he crashed on the island. This eventually leads her to man�s world where she becomes Wonder Woman.
